 # Weather-Application
 This weather app allows users to search for and view current weather conditions in any city. The app is built using the MERN stack, which consists of:

MongoDB: (Optional) For storing user-related data, such as saved cities or user preferences.
Express.js: A backend web framework used to handle API requests and server-side logic.
React.js: A frontend library used to create a responsive user interface.
Node.js: The runtime environment that runs the Express server.

Key Features:

Real-time Weather Data: Fetches weather information using the OpenWeather API.
City Search: Users can enter a city name to get the latest weather data.
Responsive Design: Works well across different devices, including desktops and mobile devices.

How It Works:

Backend (Node.js + Express): Handles API requests, communicates with the OpenWeather API, and sends the weather data to the frontend.
Frontend (React): Displays the weather information to the user, with a simple input field to search for different cities.

Usage:

Enter City Name: Users type the name of a city into the input field.
Retrieve Weather Data: The app displays current weather conditions like temperature, weather description, and city name.
This app is a practical example of how to integrate a third-party API into a full-stack JavaScript application, showcasing the use of the MERN stack in building modern web applications.
